### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/cloud-native-skunkworks/khole.git
make install 
make deploy
```

Apply the CR with your details

```
kubectl apply -f config/samples/core_v1alpha1_kholeconfiguration.yaml
```

###Â Development

This is a typical kubebuilder project. 
It has no webhook so you can just `go run` as long as you have a valid `KUBECONFIG` env. You'll need to install the custom resources.

If you want to build the docker image just override the `IMG` env variable in the make file e.g. `IMG=your-registry/khole:latest make docker-build`
